Work done on .vcf files using Java and Excel. Dr. Itsik Pe'er was my PI.
Included is a single example of the code I used.
The code was roughly all the same, involving text parsing.
The .vcfs were large, about 6gb each, so make analysis quick I uploaded the .vcfs and java programs to a server where I had access to a cluster computer.
My lab presentation and paper are available on my linkedin profile, www.linkedin.com/in/DiegoParis
